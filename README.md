# Smartphone Remote Control with Node.js and Socket.io 

Likewise Chromecast is able to be manipulated by your own cell phone, I had an idea to create a slideshow with the intention of being manipulated by the cell phone.

 We are going to use Node.js and Socket.io to remotely control a presentation that is running on your laptop with your phone.

 Reveal.js - it will handle animations and transitions between slides, as well as support for keyboard and touch events.
